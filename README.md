A custom watch face based Udacity's project Sunshine. The watch face shows the digital time in 12 hour format, the high and low temperature, and an icon showing the weather conditions (clear, light rain, etc). The weather information is sent from the Sunshine app's SyncAdapter to the WeatherReceiver in the digitalWatchFace Android Wear app.
